# TaskDetailPanel Refactoring

This directory contains the refactored TaskDetailPanel component, which was previously a single 1,767-line file.

## Components

### `TaskDetailPanel` (Main Container)
- Orchestrates all child components
- Handles event handlers that interact with stores
- Uses `useTaskDetail` hook for state management
- Provides tab navigation (Overview, Subtasks, Logs)

### `TaskHeader`
- Task title with overflow tooltip
- Spec ID badge
- Status badges (Running, Stuck, Incomplete, etc.)
- Edit and close buttons

### `TaskProgress`
- Execution phase indicator (Planning, Coding, Validation)
- Progress bar with animation
- Phase progress segments visualization
- Subtask completion counter

### `TaskMetadata`
- Classification badges (Category, Priority, Complexity, Impact, etc.)
- Description with markdown sanitization
- Detailed metadata (Rationale, Problem Solved, Target Audience, etc.)
- Acceptance criteria and affected files
- Timeline (Created/Updated timestamps)

### `TaskActions`
- Primary action button (Start/Stop/Resume/Recover)
- Task completion indicator
- Delete button with confirmation dialog

### `TaskWarnings`
- Stuck task warning with recovery button
- Incomplete task warning with resume button

### `TaskSubtasks`
- List of implementation subtasks
- Status indicators for each subtask
- File associations
- Progress summary

### `TaskLogs`
- Phase-based collapsible log viewer
- Tool usage tracking (Read, Write, Edit, Bash, etc.)
- Expandable log entry details
- Auto-scroll with user control
- Interrupted phase detection

### `TaskReview`
- Workspace status (files changed, commits, additions/deletions)
- View changes dialog
- Stage-only option for IDE review
- Merge/Discard actions
- QA feedback textarea for requesting changes
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions

### `useTaskDetail` Hook
- Consolidates all component state
- Manages side effects (loading, watching, checking)
- Provides event handlers for scroll and phase toggling
- Abstracts complex state logic from UI components

## Benefits of Refactoring

1. **Maintainability**: Each component has a single responsibility and is easier to understand
2. **Testability**: Smaller components are easier to test in isolation
3. **Reusability**: Components can be reused or customized independently
4. **Performance**: Easier to optimize individual components with React.memo if needed
5. **Developer Experience**: Easier to navigate and modify specific features
6. **Code Organization**: Related functionality is grouped together

## Usage

The original `TaskDetailPanel.tsx` file at the parent level now re-exports the refactored component for backwards compatibility:

```typescript
// From parent components directory
import { TaskDetailPanel } from './TaskDetailPanel';

// Or from the new directory
import { TaskDetailPanel } from './task-detail';
```

All existing imports continue to work without changes.

## Migration Notes

- No breaking changes to the public API
- All props remain the same
- All functionality preserved
- Original file kept as re-export for backwards compatibility
