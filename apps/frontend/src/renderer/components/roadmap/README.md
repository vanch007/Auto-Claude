# Roadmap Component Architecture

This directory contains the refactored Roadmap component, broken down into smaller, maintainable modules.

## Overview

The original `Roadmap.tsx` (764 lines) has been refactored into:
- **Main component**: `Roadmap.tsx` (123 lines) - 84% reduction
- **Modular sub-components**: 10 separate files organized by concern
- **Clear separation**: UI components, logic hooks, utilities, and types

## File Structure

```

## Component Breakdown

### Main Entry Point
- **`Roadmap.tsx`**: Orchestrates the entire roadmap view, manages state, and composes sub-components

### UI Components

#### `RoadmapHeader.tsx`
- Displays project name, vision, and status
- Shows target audience information
- Renders feature statistics and priority breakdown
- Action buttons (Add Feature, Refresh)

#### `RoadmapEmptyState.tsx`
- Initial state when no roadmap exists
- Single "Generate Roadmap" CTA

#### `RoadmapTabs.tsx`
- Tab navigation (Phases, All Features, By Priority, Kanban)
- Renders appropriate view based on active tab
- Delegates to PhaseCard, FeatureCard, and RoadmapKanbanView

#### `PhaseCard.tsx`
- Individual phase card with status indicator
- Progress bar showing completion
- Milestone list with status
- Feature preview (up to 5) with actions

#### `FeatureCard.tsx`
- Compact feature card display
- Priority, complexity, and impact badges
- Competitor insight indicator
- Build/View Task actions

#### `FeatureDetailPanel.tsx`
- Slide-in side panel for feature details
- Full description, rationale, and metrics
- User stories and acceptance criteria
- Dependencies and competitor insights
- Convert to task or view existing task actions

### Logic and State

#### `hooks.ts`
Three custom hooks for managing roadmap logic:

1. **`useRoadmapData(projectId)`**
   - Loads and provides roadmap data
   - Returns: `{ roadmap, competitorAnalysis, generationStatus }`

2. **`useFeatureActions()`**
   - Handles feature-related actions
   - Returns: `{ convertFeatureToSpec }`

3. **`useRoadmapGeneration(projectId)`**
   - Manages roadmap generation flow
   - Handles competitor analysis dialog
   - Returns generation handlers and dialog state

### Utilities

#### `utils.ts`
- **`getCompetitorInsightsForFeature()`**: Extracts competitor pain points for a feature
- **`hasCompetitorInsight()`**: Checks if a feature has competitor insights

#### `types.ts`
TypeScript interfaces for all component props:
- `RoadmapProps`
- `RoadmapHeaderProps`
- `RoadmapTabsProps`
- `PhaseCardProps`
- `FeatureCardProps`
- `FeatureDetailPanelProps`
- `RoadmapEmptyStateProps`

## Design Principles

### Separation of Concerns
- **UI Components**: Pure presentation logic
- **Custom Hooks**: State management and side effects
- **Utilities**: Reusable helper functions
- **Types**: Centralized type definitions

### Component Composition
The main `Roadmap.tsx` now serves as a thin orchestration layer:
```tsx
<Roadmap>
  <RoadmapHeader />
  <RoadmapTabs>
    <PhaseCard />
    <FeatureCard />
  </RoadmapTabs>
  <FeatureDetailPanel />
</Roadmap>
```

### Reusability
- Components can be used independently
- Hooks can be reused in other components
- Utilities are framework-agnostic
- Types ensure consistency

### Maintainability
- Single Responsibility Principle: Each file has one clear purpose
- Smaller files (23-204 lines) are easier to understand and modify
- Clear naming conventions
- Well-defined interfaces

## Usage

Import from the module:

```tsx
// Import the main component
import { Roadmap } from './components/Roadmap';

// Or import specific parts
import {
  RoadmapHeader,
  FeatureCard,
  useRoadmapData
} from './components/roadmap';
```

## Benefits of This Refactoring

1. **Improved Readability**: Each file focuses on a single concern
2. **Better Testability**: Smaller components and pure functions are easier to test
3. **Enhanced Reusability**: Components can be used in different contexts
4. **Easier Maintenance**: Changes to one aspect don't affect others
5. **Better Type Safety**: Centralized types with proper TypeScript support
6. **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Developers can focus on one piece at a time
7. **Scalability**: Easy to add new features or modify existing ones

## Migration Notes

- All functionality remains identical to the original implementation
- No breaking changes to the public API
- Import paths updated to use the new structure
- TypeScript compilation verified with no new errors
